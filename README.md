## 🧠 Overview  
**Clinical QA System** is an AI-powered **question answering web application** that extracts medical information from patient clinical reports using **Transformer-based NLP models**.  
Users can paste a report and ask questions like:  
> “What disease does the patient have?”  
> “What medications were prescribed?”  
> “What treatment was provided?”

Built with **Flask**, **PyTorch**, and **Hugging Face Transformers**, this project helps convert unstructured clinical data into structured, searchable insights for healthcare professionals, researchers, and students.

## ⚙️ Features  

✅ Transformer-based Question Answering (Extractive QA)  
✅ Flask web interface with modern UI design  
✅ Healthcare awareness blog and government scheme links  
✅ Local feedback and simulated login form  
✅ Lightweight, modular, and ready for deployment

## 🌐 Web Pages Overview  

| Page | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Home.html** | Landing page introducing the system |
| **qa.html** | Core Q&A interface for report analysis |
| **sample.html** | Healthcare awareness and information blog |
| **tiles.html** | Government health schemes and resources |
| **index.html** | Contact & feedback page |

---

## 🧩 How It Works  

1. User pastes the **clinical report text**.  
2. User enters a **question** in natural language.  
3. The Transformer model encodes both question and context.  
4. The model identifies and extracts the **answer span**.  
5. Flask displays the result dynamically in the web interface.
